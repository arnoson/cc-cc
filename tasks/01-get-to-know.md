# Get to know each other

1. Possible questions:

- What's your name and your department?
- Not a question, but: Please show us your illustrations!
- Are there certain motives, techniques, pens or tools that you use regularly or find interesting?
- Do you have any coding experience?
  - If so, what have you coded?
  - If not, are there any areas where you would have liked to use it
- What do you enjoy most about illustrating and/or programming?
- Have you ever spent way too much time automating a task with code? Or spend way too much time illustrating something repetitive or overly detailed?

2. Analyze your computer/human drawings (e.g. certain patterns, things you tried to avoid, different drawing styles, ...)
