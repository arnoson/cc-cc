2. Go to the main page of this repository (https://github.com/arnoson/cc-cc) and click on the green _Code_ button on the right, then select _Download ZIP_ and extract the downloaded folder on your computer
3. Open Visual Studio Code and open the folder with `File > Open Folder`
4. A prompt will appear in the bottom right corner, asking `Do you want to install the recommended extensions from Prettier and Microsoft for this repository?` Click `install`
5. Go to the settings `File > Preferences > Settings` and search for _Live Preview: Open Preview Target_ and select _External Browser_
6. To check if everything works correctly, open the file `playground/index.html` in the explorer on the left, click the small icon on the top right that looks like an opened book with a magnifying glass and a new browser window should open that shows a red circle. If you edit the code in `playground/index.js` you get a live preview in the browser of what you are doing.
