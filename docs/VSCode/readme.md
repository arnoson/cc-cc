# VSCode

Note: for the shortcuts I use `Cmd` for the Command key on MacOS. On Windows this key is called Control.

## Search

Search for something inside a file

`Cmd` + `F`

## Global search

Search for something inside _all_ your files

`Cmd` + `Shift` + `F`

## Rename a Variable

Right click on the variable and select `Rename Symbol` (or use the shortcut `F12`)
